  ## Description
  This application, Team Profile Generator, allows the user to create a webpage that captures their team information for the manager, engineer(s) and intern(s). The application will prompt the user with questions that they can answer in detail, which will then populate an index.html file under the /dist folder, and they can open this in their browser to see the formatted results. This helps the user visualize their team and they can also click the email links for the manager, engineer(s) intern to email them directly, as well as click on the engineer's GitHub username to take them to their GitHub profile page.
